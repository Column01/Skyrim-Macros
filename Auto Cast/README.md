# Auto Cast

Use this script to automatically cast a spell repeatedly for leveling that school of magic.

## Common uses

### Conjuration

- Kill something living (animal, person, etc.) and move it to a safe location
- Equip the "Soul Trap" spell and then use this to cast it on the dead thing over and over for fast conjuration leveling.

NOTE: USLEEP **must** be disabled in order for this to work as it patches it! (**U**nofficial **S**kyrim **Le**gendary **E**dition **P**atch)

### Illusion

- Cast the "Courage" spell on the Talos preacher (Heimskr) in Whiterun until lvl 30 or so
- Then cast "Muffle" while standing in Dragon's Reach until lvl 100
