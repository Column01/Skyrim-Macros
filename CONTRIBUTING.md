# Contributing
- Make a folder with a meaningful name and place the script and any dependant files in it (config files, a readme if needed, etc.)

- Include a description of your macro in the pull request
    - What does it do?
    - What dependencies does it have? Why did you pick those modules/libraries?
    - What task/problem does it help complete/solve in skyrim?

- Update the README.md with the following information:
	- Every heading uses two hashes like this: `## Test`
    - Include a heading with the name of your script and `(Author: <name>)` after it. You can link your github profile in the name spot.
    - Include a section of notes about the script. Use a markdown list to display them. Do not leave the notes blank, you should have something in that spot.
    - Include a list of dependencies in a markdown list (modules you used to create them and a link to the pypi page for them)
    - If you get lost, look at the other sections in the README of other scripts.
