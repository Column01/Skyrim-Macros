# Auto Cast

Use this script to automatically cast a spell that needs to be held for leveling that school of magic.

## Common uses

### Restoration

- Bring a follower (Lydia) to High Hrothgar's courtyard near the wind barrier
- Save the game (in case something goes wrong)
- Equip the "Healing Hands" spell
- Talk to your follower and ask them to wait inside the frost barrier. They should take damage but **should not** be able to die as they are protected NPCs
- Aim at them and start the script

**PLEASE** remember to save in case something goes wrong! Do not quick save, make an entirely new save so it doesn't get overwritten or lost.
