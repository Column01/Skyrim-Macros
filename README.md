# Skyrim Macros

A Collection of macros I'm writing for my skyrim playthrough to make things easier.

## Auto Transmute

### Notes
- Stand in a safe spot
- Use `Ctrl+C` to exit the program. You must be tabbed into the console window for it to work
- It will calculate if you can only single cast. It will also tell you if you can only single cast so be sure to read all prompts in the console and follow the instructions.
- Using even numbers for the number of ores is best since you need 2 gold ore to make 1 ingot. If you enter an odd number, your final amount of ores you wanted transmuted will vary by +/- one
- Install the dependencies below
